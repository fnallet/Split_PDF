This tool allows you to split a file of several pages according to a specific criterion.

The "LectureChampsPDF" file displays all the fields of the PDF file which will appear in the same folder as the "LectureChampsPDF.py" file

Depending on the keyword retained and the number of occurrences after it to reach the desired field, you will fill in the data.txt file.

Respect the following order:

1st line: Enter the access path or leave the PDF file to cut.
2nd line: Enter the access path where you will recover the cut pdf files.
3rd line: Put keyword retained
3rd line: Enter the number of occurrences

Then launch the Split.py file
